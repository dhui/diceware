About
=====
Generates passphrases using the Diceware method.
For more information about the Diceware method, see: http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.htm

===========
Downloading
===========
You may download diceware in the `releases <https://github.com/dhui/diceware/releases>`_ section

==============
Python Version
==============
If you're using Python 3, you'll need to use any v2.0.0 release or later

If you're using Python 2, you'll need to use any v1 release. e.g. Any release before v2.0.0

v1 will continue to be receive security fixes/updates but will not get any new features or functionality.

I've opted to not stay in the transitional phase where the code base supports both Python 2 and 3.

=====
Usage
=====
.. code:: bash

    python diceware.py

For help, run:

.. code:: bash

    python diceware.py -h
